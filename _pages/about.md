I am currently a Ph.D. student since 2023, advised by [Prof.Peidong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZczNEEAAAAJ), at the School of Engineering, [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn//) in collaboration with [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), Hangzhou, China. My previous research focused on **geometry and optimization problems in 3D Computer Vision**. Recently, I have been attempting to build an intelligent agent, **TIC**, in a probability space. This framework involves three core sub-tasks: **transport** (learning the dynamics of probability), **inference** (inferring probability from observations), and **control** (steering probability towards a target). Although these three tasks may seem independent, I hope to model and solve them under a unified language. This will give rise to a completely new interdisciplinary field that combines **Generation** (Diffusion Models, Flow Matching), **Control** (Stochastic Optimal Control, Reinforcement Learning), **Sampling**, **Transport** (SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge, Trajectory Inference, Optimal Transport), **Game** (Mean Field Game), and **Optimization**. Open to collaboration! ðŸ˜Š

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in the College of Electrical and Information Engineering from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), Changsha, China.  

I also served as a reviewer for the **CVPR**, **ICCV**, **NeurIPS**, **AAAI**, **ACM MM**, **3DV**, **ICRA**, **IROS** and **RAL**.
