I am currently a Ph.D. student since 2023, advised by [Prof.Peidong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZczNEEAAAAJ), at the School of Engineering, [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn//) in collaboration with [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), Hangzhou, China. My previous research focused on **geometry and optimization problems in 3D Computer Vision**. Recently, I have been involved in an emerging research area, combining **Deep Generative Models**, **Optimal Transport**, **Stochastic Optimal Control**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. Specifically, I am interested in advancing new fundamental algorithms to enhance **optimal transport**, **SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge Problem**, and **Diffusion Models**. Open to collaboration! ðŸ˜Š

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in the College of Electrical and Information Engineering from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), Changsha, China.

I also served as a reviewer for the **CVPR**, **AAAI**, **3DV**, **ICRA**, and **RAL**.
